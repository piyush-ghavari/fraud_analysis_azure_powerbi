# fraud_analysis_azure_powerbi

This is a complete **end-to-end data analytics project** focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.
Using real-world style transaction data, the project replicates how analysts identify patterns in fraud using cloud-integrated workflows and interactive dashboards.

The project simulates a financial institution’s effort to monitor, analyze, and prevent fraudulent behavior — through data exploration, trend analysis, and visual storytelling.

**Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to simulate how actual data analysts in the financial and banking sectors work behind the scenes to analyze transactions and detect fraud using cloud-based infrastructure and business intelligence tools.

In this end-to-end project, we:

✅ **Ingest real-world transaction data** and securely store it in **Azure Blob Storage**

✅ Use **Python** for **data exploration** and **data cleaning**, including handling nulls, fixing data types, and preparing the data for analysis

✅ Create a cleaned dataset and **upload it back to Azure** to establish a **cloud-based data pipeline**

✅ Use **Power BI** to develop an interactive dashboard that enables users to filter by fraud status, merchant category, and more

✅ Derive **business-driven fraud insights**, including high-risk months, customer demographics, merchant risk, and payment vulnerabilities
